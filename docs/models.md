# Supported Models

Higgs detects local model support from `config.json` `model_type`. The tables below are representative rather than exhaustive.

## Supported Architectures

| Architecture | `model_type` | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| LLaMA | `llama` | Llama 3 and CodeLlama |
| Mistral | `mistral` | Mistral 7B |
| Qwen2 | `qwen2` | Qwen2 and Qwen2.5 |
| Qwen3 | `qwen3` | Qwen3 |
| Qwen3.5 (dense) | `qwen3_5` | Qwen3.5 dense MLX checkpoints |
| Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.6 MoE | `qwen3_5_moe` | Qwen3.5-35B-A3B, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B |
| Qwen3-Next | `qwen3_next` | Qwen3-Coder hybrid checkpoints |
| Qwen3-MoE | `qwen3_moe` | Qwen3-30B-A3B |
| Gemma 2 | `gemma2` | Gemma 2 2B, 9B, and 27B |
| Phi-3 | `phi3` | Phi-3 Mini, Small, and Medium |
| Starcoder2 | `starcoder2` | Starcoder2 3B, 7B, and 15B |
| DeepSeek-V2 | `deepseek_v2` | DeepSeek-V2-Lite |
| LLaVA-Qwen2 | `llava-qwen2` | nanoLLaVA-1.5 |
| Nemotron-Labs-Diffusion | `nemotron_labs_diffusion` | Nemotron-Labs-Diffusion 3B/8B/14B (diffusion-mode decode) |

## Continuous Batching Support

`batch=true` enables true batched decode only for these `model_type` values:

- `llama`
- `mistral`
- `qwen2`
- `qwen3`

Other supported architectures still serve normally in simple mode, but Higgs now rejects `batch=true` during config load, `doctor`, and server startup.

## Representative Working MLX Model IDs

| Family | Example model IDs |
|---|---|
| LLaMA | `mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit` |
| Qwen2.5 | `mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit` |
| Qwen3 | `mlx-community/Qwen3-1.7B-4bit` |
| Qwen3-Next | `mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-Next-4bit` |
| Qwen3.5 dense | `mlx-community/Qwen3.5-27B-Claude-4.6-Opus-Distilled-MLX-4bit` |
| Qwen3.5 MoE | `NexVeridian/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-3bit` |
| Qwen3.6 MoE | `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit` |
| DeepSeek-V2 | `mlx-community/DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct-4bit-mlx` |

## Qwen 3.6 Notes

- `Qwen3.6` support currently uses the `qwen3_5_moe` loader path.
- The cached-model smoke matrix covered `mlx-community/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-4bit` plus `mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit`, `mlx-community/Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct-4bit`, `mlx-community/Qwen3-1.7B-4bit`, and `mlx-community/Qwen3-Coder-Next-4bit`.
- OpenAI-style chat requests use non-thinking mode by default for `Qwen3.6` unless the request explicitly opts into reasoning.

## Nemotron-Labs-Diffusion Notes

- `nemotron_labs_diffusion` runs in **diffusion mode**: the model denoises blocks
  of masked tokens in parallel (bidirectional attention, YaRN RoPE) rather than
  decoding one token at a time. `block_size` and `diffusion_steps` are read from
  `config.json`.
- Decoding is greedy in this release; per-token logprobs are not surfaced, and
  streaming emits the full generation as a single chunk. The model's
  autoregressive and self-speculation modes are planned follow-ups.

## Model Input Requirements

- Local models can be referenced by Hugging Face model ID or local path.
- The model must be in MLX `safetensors` format.
- The checkpoint must use a supported `config.json` `model_type`.
- macOS local serving requires `mlx.metallib` next to the executable. Release artifacts bundle it, and source builds restore it from Cargo build output when possible.

For configuration details, see [configuration.md](configuration.md).
